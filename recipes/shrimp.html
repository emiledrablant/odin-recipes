    <p>Some Spicy Shrimp is the shortest road to Heaven, at least for me. Why is that so, you ask? Simple enough: as I'm allergic to it,
        just eating one of these curly thingies would kill me in less than twenty minutes. That's actually how my ex girlfriend Sandra tried to get rid
        of me back in 1995. Granted, we were in primary school, she didn't know I was allergic to shrimps and I wasn't either. Also, she didn't try to
        "get rid of me", I just wrote that to be more dramatic. We actually broke up when she refused to share some candies with me. I'm still a sugar
        digger to this very day. Maybe I'll add some desserts on this website.</p>
